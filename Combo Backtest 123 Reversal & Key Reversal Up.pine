//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  A  key  reversal  is  a  one-day  trading  pattern  that  may  signal  the  reversal  of  a  trend.
//  Other  frequently-used  names  for  key  reversal  include  "one-day  reversal"  and  "reversal  day."
//  How  Does  a  Key  Reversal  Work?
//  Depending  on  which  way  the  stock  is  trending,  a  key  reversal  day  occurs  when:
//  In  an  uptrend  --  prices  hit  a  new  high  and  then  close  near  the  previous  day's  lows.
//  In  a  downtrend  --  prices  hit  a  new  low,  but  close  near  the  previous  day's  highs
//
//  WARNING:
//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
