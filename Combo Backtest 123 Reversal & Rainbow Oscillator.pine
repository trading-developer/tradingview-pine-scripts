//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Ever  since  the  people  concluded  that  stock  market  price  movements  are  not
//  random  or  chaotic,  but  follow  specific  trends  that  can  be  forecasted,  they
//  tried  to  develop  different  tools  or  procedures  that  could  help  them  identify
//  those  trends.  And  one  of  those  financial  indicators  is  the  Rainbow  Oscillator
//  Indicator.  The  Rainbow  Oscillator  Indicator  is  relatively  new,  originally
//  introduced  in  1997,  and  it  is  used  to  forecast  the  changes  of  trend  direction.
//  As  market  prices  go  up  and  down,  the  oscillator  appears  as  a  direction  of  the
//  trend,  but  also  as  the  safety  of  the  market  and  the  depth  of  that  trend.  As
//  the  rainbow  grows  in  width,  the  current  trend  gives  signs  of  continuity,  and
//  if  the  value  of  the  oscillator  goes  beyond  80,  the  market  becomes  more  and  more
//  unstable,  being  prone  to  a  sudden  reversal.  When  prices  move  towards  the  rainbow
//  and  the  oscillator  becomes  more  and  more  flat,  the  market  tends  to  remain  more
//  stable  and  the  bandwidth  decreases.  Still,  if  the  oscillator  value  goes  below  20,
//  the  market  is  again,  prone  to  sudden  reversals.  The  safest  bandwidth  value  where
//  the  market  is  stable  is  between  20  and  80,  in  the  Rainbow  Oscillator  indicator  value.
//  The  depth  a  certain  price  has  on  a  chart  and  into  the  rainbow  can  be  used  to  judge
//  the  strength  of  the  move.
