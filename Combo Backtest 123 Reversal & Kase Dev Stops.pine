//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//    The  Kase  Dev  Stops  system  finds  the  optimal  statistical  balance  between  letting  profits  run,
//    while  cutting  losses.    Kase  DevStop  seeks  an  ideal  stop  level  by  accounting  for  volatility  (risk),
//    the  variance  in  volatility  (the  change  in  volatility  from  bar  to  bar),  and  volatility  skew
//    (the  propensity  for  volatility  to  occasionally  spike  incorrectly).
//    Kase  Dev  Stops  are  set  at  points  at  which  there  is  an  increasing  probability  of  reversal  against
//    the  trend  being  statistically  significant  based  on  the  log  normal  shape  of  the  range  curve.
//    Setting  stops  will  help  you  take  as  much  risk  as  necessary  to  stay  in  a  good  position,  but  not  more.
//
//  You  can  change  long  to  short  in  the  Input  Settings
//  Please,  use  it  only  for  learning  or  paper  trading.  Do  not  for  real  trading.
//
//  WARNING:
//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
