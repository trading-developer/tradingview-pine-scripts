//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  Moving  Average  Crossover  trading  strategy  is  possibly  the  most  popular
//  trading  strategy  in  the  world  of  trading.  First  of  them  were  written  in  the
//  middle  of  XX  century,  when  commodities  trading  strategies  became  popular.
//  This  strategy  is  a  good  example  of  so-called  traditional  strategies.
//  Traditional  strategies  are  always  long  or  short.  That  means  they  are  never
//  out  of  the  market.  The  concept  of  having  a  strategy  that  is  always  long  or
//  short  may  be  scary,  particularly  in  today’s  market  where  you  don’t  know  what
//  is  going  to  happen  as  far  as  risk  on  any  one  market.  But  a  lot  of  traders
//  believe  that  the  concept  is  still  valid,  especially  for  those  of  traders  who
//  do  their  own  research  or  their  own  discretionary  trading.
//  This  version  uses  crossover  of  moving  average  and  its  exponential  moving  average.
