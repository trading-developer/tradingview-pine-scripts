Script Name: Buy and hold strategy
Author: sondergaardson
Description: A simple buy and hold strategy. A short or a long position can be chosen. The start date will determine the date where your position will start and end date is the date it will end. This works well as a baseline to your other existing strategies since buy and hold is just the simplest strategy available.
