//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Smart  money  index  (SMI)  or  smart  money  flow  index  is  a  technical  analysis  indicator  demonstrating  investors  sentiment.
//  The  index  was  invented  and  popularized  by  money  manager  Don  Hays.[1]  The  indicator  is  based  on  intra-day  price  patterns.
//  The  main  idea  is  that  the  majority  of  traders  (emotional,  news-driven)  overreact  at  the  beginning  of  the  trading  day
//  because  of  the  overnight  news  and  economic  data.  There  is  also  a  lot  of  buying  on  market  orders  and  short  covering  at  the  opening.
//  Smart,  experienced  investors  start  trading  closer  to  the  end  of  the  day  having  the  opportunity  to  evaluate  market  performance.
//  Therefore,  the  basic  strategy  is  to  bet  against  the  morning  price  trend  and  bet  with  the  evening  price  trend.  The  SMI  may  be  calculated
//  for  many  markets  and  market  indices  (S&P  500,  DJIA,  etc.)
//
//  The  SMI  sends  no  clear  signal  whether  the  market  is  bullish  or  bearish.  There  are  also  no  fixed  absolute  or  relative  readings  signaling
//  about  the  trend.  Traders  need  to  look  at  the  SMI  dynamics  relative  to  that  of  the  market.  If,  for  example,  SMI  rises  sharply  when  the
//  market  falls,  this  fact  would  mean  that  smart  money  is  buying,  and  the  market  is  to  revert  to  an  uptrend  soon.  The  opposite  situation
//  is  also  true.  A  rapidly  falling  SMI  during  a  bullish  market  means  that  smart  money  is  selling  and  that  market  is  to  revert  to  a  downtrend
//  soon.  The  SMI  is,  therefore,  a  trend-based  indicator.
//  Some  analysts  use  the  smart  money  index  to  claim  that  precious  metals  such  as  gold  will  continually  maintain  value  in  the  future.
