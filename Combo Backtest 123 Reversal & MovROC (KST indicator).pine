//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  This  indicator  really  is  the  KST  indicator  presented  by  Martin  Pring.
//  the  KST  indicator  is  a  weighted  summed  rate  of  change  oscillator  that
//  is  designed  to  identify  meaningful  turns.  Various  smoothed  rate  of  change
//  indicators  can  be  combined  to  form  different  measurements  of  cycles.
