Script Name: Consecutive Up-Down Strat + alerts via TradingConnector to Forex
Author: Peter_O
Description: Software part of algotrading is simpler than you think. TradingView is a great place to do this actually. To present it, I'm publishing each of the default strategies you can find in Pinescript editor's "built-in" list with slight modification - I'm only adding 2 lines of code, which will trigger alerts, ready to be forwarded to your broker via TradingConnector...
PineScript code:

Pine Scriptâ„¢ strategy
Consecutive Up/Down Strat + alerts via TradingConnector to Forex
//@version=4
strategy("Consecutive  Up/Down  Strategy  with  alerts  via  TradingConnector  to  Forex",  overlay=true,  default_qty_value=1000)
consecutiveBarsUp  =  input(3)
consecutiveBarsDown  =  input(3)
price  =  close
ups  =  0.0
ups  :=  price  >  price[1]  ?  nz(ups[1])  +  1  :  0
dns  =  0.0
dns  :=  price  <  price[1]  ?  nz(dns[1])  +  1  :  0
if  (ups  >=  consecutiveBarsUp)
        strategy.entry("ConsUpLE",  strategy.long,  comment="ConsUpLE")
        alert(message='long',  freq=alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)
if  (dns  >=  consecutiveBarsDown)
        strategy.entry("ConsDnSE",  strategy.short,  comment="ConsUpLE")
        alert(message='short',  freq=alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)
//plot(strategy.equity,  title="equity",  color=color.red,  linewidth=2,  style=plot.style_areabr)
//Lines  of  code  added  to  the  original  built-in  script:  12  and  15  only.
//They  trigger  alerts  ready  to  be  executed  on  real  markets  through  TradingConnector
//available  for  Forex,  indices,  crypto,  stocks  -  anything  your  broker  offers  for  trading  via  MetaTrader4/5
