Script Name: Strategy Timeframe
Author: melihtuna
Description: Hello!
Until now, it was among all my strategy codes, but I wanted to share it alone. You can use this code to see strategy results or indicator results within a specific date range. It will be sufficient to add window() condition to the trading or alarm conditions. If time information is also important, you can change the Timestamp interval in the code.
