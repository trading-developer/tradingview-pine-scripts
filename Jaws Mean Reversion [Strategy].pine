Script Name: Jaws Mean Reversion [Strategy]
Author: TraderHalai
Description: This very simple strategy is an implementation of PJ Sutherlands' Jaws Mean reversion algorithm. It simply buys when a small moving average period (e.g. 2) is below
a longer moving average period (e.g. 5) by a certain percentage and closes when the small period average crosses over the longer moving average.
