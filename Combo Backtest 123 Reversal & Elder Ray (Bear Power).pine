//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Developed  by  Dr  Alexander  Elder,  the  Elder-ray  indicator  measures  buying
//  and  selling  pressure  in  the  market.  The  Elder-ray  is  often  used  as  part
//  of  the  Triple  Screen  trading  system  but  may  also  be  used  on  its  own.
//  Dr  Elder  uses  a  13-day  exponential  moving  average  (EMA)  to  indicate  the
//  market  consensus  of  value.  Bull  Power  measures  the  ability  of  buyers  to
//  drive  prices  above  the  consensus  of  value.  Bear  Power  reflects  the  ability
//  of  sellers  to  drive  prices  below  the  average  consensus  of  value.
//  Bull  Power  is  calculated  by  subtracting  the  13-day  EMA  from  the  day's  High.
//  Bear  power  subtracts  the  13-day  EMA  from  the  day's  Low.
//  You  can  use  in  the  xPrice  any  series:  Open,  High,  Low,  Close,  HL2,  HLC3,  OHLC4  and  ect...
