//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  FVE  is  a  pure  volume  indicator.  Unlike  most  of  the  other  indicators
//  (except  OBV),  price  change  doesn?t  come  into  the  equation  for  the  FVE  (price
//  is  not  multiplied  by  volume),  but  is  only  used  to  determine  whether  money  is
//  flowing  in  or  out  of  the  stock.  This  is  contrary  to  the  current  trend  in  the
//  design  of  modern  money  flow  indicators.  The  author  decided  against  a  price-volume
//  indicator  for  the  following  reasons:
//  -  A  pure  volume  indicator  has  more  power  to  contradict.
//  -  The  number  of  buyers  or  sellers  (which  is  assessed  by  volume)  will  be  the  same,
//          regardless  of  the  price  fluctuation.
//  -  Price-volume  indicators  tend  to  spike  excessively  at  breakouts  or  breakdowns.
//
//  WARNING:
//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
