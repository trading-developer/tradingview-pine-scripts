//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price

//  Second  strategy
//  The  Gann  Swing  Oscillator  has  been  adapted  from  Robert  Krausz's  book,
