//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//    Market  prices  do  not  have  a  Gaussian  probability  density  function
//    as  many  traders  think.  Their  probability  curve  is  not  bell-shaped.
//    But  trader  can  create  a  nearly  Gaussian  PDF  for  prices  by  normalizing
//    them  or  creating  a  normalized  indicator  such  as  the  relative  strength
//    index  and  applying  the  Fisher  transform.  Such  a  transformed  output
//    creates  the  peak  swings  as  relatively  rare  events.
//    Fisher  transform  formula  is:  y  =  0.5  *  ln  ((1+x)/(1-x))
//    The  sharp  turning  points  of  these  peak  swings  clearly  and  unambiguously
//    identify  price  reversals  in  a  timely  manner.
//
//  WARNING:
//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
