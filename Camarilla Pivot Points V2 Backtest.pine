//  Camarilla  pivot  point  formula  is  the  refined  form  of  existing  classic  pivot  point  formula.
//  The  Camarilla  method  was  developed  by  Nick  Stott  who  was  a  very  successful  bond  trader.
//  What  makes  it  better  is  the  use  of  Fibonacci  numbers  in  calculation  of  levels.
//
//  Camarilla  equations  are  used  to  calculate  intraday  support  and  resistance  levels  using
//  the  previous  days  volatility  spread.  Camarilla  equations  take  previous  day’s  high,  low  and
//  close  as  input  and  generates  8  levels  of  intraday  support  and  resistance  based  on  pivot  points.
//  There  are  4  levels  above  pivot  point  and  4  levels  below  pivot  points.  The  most  important  levels
//  are  L3  L4  and  H3  H4.  H3  and  L3  are  the  levels  to  go  against  the  trend  with  stop  loss  around  H4  or  L4  .
//  While  L4  and  H4  are  considered  as  breakout  levels  when  these  levels  are  breached  its  time  to
//  trade  with  the  trend.
