//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Taken  from  an  article  "The  Yen  Recused"  in  the  December  1998  issue  of  TASC,
//  written  by  Dennis  Meyers.  He  describes  the  Recursive  MA  in  mathematical  terms
//  as  "recursive  polynomial  fit,  a  technique  that  uses  a  small  number  of  past  values
//  of  the  estimated  price  and  today's  price  to  predict  tomorrows  price."
//  Red  bars  color  -  short  position.  Green  is  long.

//  WARNING:
//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
