//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  This  is  another  version  of  FVE  indicator  that  we  have  posted  earlier
//  in  this  forum.
//  This  version  has  an  important  enhancement  to  the  previous  one  that`s
//  especially  useful  with  intraday  minute  charts.
//  Due  to  the  volatility  had  not  been  taken  into  account  to  avoid  the  extra
//  complication  in  the  formula,  the  previous  formula  has  some  drawbacks:
//  The  main  drawback  is  that  the  constant  cutoff  coefficient  will  overestimate
//  price  changes  in  minute  charts  and  underestimate  corresponding  changes  in
//  weekly  or  monthly  charts.
//  And  now  the  indicator  uses  adaptive  cutoff  coefficient  which  will  adjust  to
//  all  time  frames  automatically.

//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
