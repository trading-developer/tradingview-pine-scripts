Script Name: MACD Long Strat
Author: TheGrindToday
Description: First script I've written, but the concept is pretty simple. This uses the MACD with settings fast_SMA = 6 and slow SMA=16 and uses the distance between the 2 (histogram) to look for potential trend reversals to flag potential entries for Long trades. It waits for the confirmation looking backward 2 x timeframes (to reduce false calls slightly). You can adjust it...
