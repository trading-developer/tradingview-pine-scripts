//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  MACD  –  Moving  Average  Convergence  Divergence.  The  MACD  is  calculated
//  by  subtracting  a  26-day  moving  average  of  a  security's  price  from  a
//  12-day  moving  average  of  its  price.  The  result  is  an  indicator  that
//  oscillates  above  and  below  zero.  When  the  MACD  is  above  zero,  it  means
//  the  12-day  moving  average  is  higher  than  the  26-day  moving  average.
//  This  is  bullish  as  it  shows  that  current  expectations  (i.e.,  the  12-day
//  moving  average)  are  more  bullish  than  previous  expectations  (i.e.,  the
//  26-day  average).  This  implies  a  bullish,  or  upward,  shift  in  the  supply/demand
//  lines.  When  the  MACD  falls  below  zero,  it  means  that  the  12-day  moving  average
//  is  less  than  the  26-day  moving  average,  implying  a  bearish  shift  in  the
//  supply/demand  lines.
//  A  9-day  moving  average  of  the  MACD  (not  of  the  security's  price)  is  usually
//  plotted  on  top  of  the  MACD  indicator.  This  line  is  referred  to  as  the  "signal"
//  line.  The  signal  line  anticipates  the  convergence  of  the  two  moving  averages
//  (i.e.,  the  movement  of  the  MACD  toward  the  zero  line).
//  Let's  consider  the  rational  behind  this  technique.  The  MACD  is  the  difference
//  between  two  moving  averages  of  price.  When  the  shorter-term  moving  average  rises
//  above  the  longer-term  moving  average  (i.e.,  the  MACD  rises  above  zero),  it  means
//  that  investor  expectations  are  becoming  more  bullish  (i.e.,  there  has  been  an
//  upward  shift  in  the  supply/demand  lines).  By  plotting  a  9-day  moving  average  of
//  the  MACD,  we  can  see  the  changing  of  expectations  (i.e.,  the  shifting  of  the
//  supply/demand  lines)  as  they  occur.
