Script Name: Please help to make Larry Williams' volatility breakthrough.
Author: kgp1202
Description: Hello Traders!

I'm going to backtest Larry Williams' volatility breakthrough strategy.
However, contrary to my expectation, orders at certain bars are made the next day.
Is there anything I missed at my pine script code?
Please give me any tiny tips.

Thank you!!
