//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  This  is  RSI  indicator  which  is  more  sesitive  to  price  changes.
//  It  is  based  upon  a  modern  math  tool  -  Laguerre  transform  filter.
//  With  help  of  Laguerre  filter  one  becomes  able  to  create  superior
//  indicators  using  very  short  data  lengths  as  well.  The  use  of  shorter
//  data  lengths  means  you  can  make  the  indicators  more  responsive  to
//  changes  in  the  price.

//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
