//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  This  back  testing  strategy  generates  a  long  trade  at  the  Open  of  the  following
//  bar  when  the  %K  line  crosses  below  the  %D  line  and  both  are  above  the  Overbought  level.
//  It  generates  a  short  trade  at  the  Open  of  the  following  bar  when  the  %K  line
//  crosses  above  the  %D  line  and  both  values  are  below  the  Oversold  level.
