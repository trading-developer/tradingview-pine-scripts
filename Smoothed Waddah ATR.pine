Description: ~~~All Credit to LAZY BEAR for posting the original Script which is an old MT4 indicator.~~~~

 No this system does not repaint... if it does let me know. Either the code is wrong or you are using a repainting chart such as renko candles.

 *PURPOSE*
This Is an "Enhanced or Smoothed" version of the script that captures the heiken-ashi closing price as its main...

////////////Entry  conditions  and  Concept/////////////////////
////////////Long  Only  System.  T1  is  measuring  the  distance  between  MACD  EMA's.  This  is  Multiplied
////////////by  the  sensitivity  so  that  it  can  be  compared  to  the  difference  between  BollingerBand.
/////////////{this  could  have  been  a  ratio  maybe  i  will  work  with  that  in  a  different  script.}
/////////////I  found  that  135-175  sensitivy  allows  for  values  to  be  compared  on  most  charts.....
////////////If  the  (difference  between  the  EMA)*(Sensitivity)  is  greater  than  (BB  upper  line-  BB  lower  line)
////////////it  is  considered  an  explosion  in  either  the  downside  or  the  upside.The  indicator  will  print
///////////a  bar  higher  than  the  trigger  line  either  green  or  red  (up  or  down  respectively)//////////////////
