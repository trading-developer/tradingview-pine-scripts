Script Name: BarUpDn Long Strategy
Author: REV0LUTI0N
Description: This is a bar up/down strategy for going long only where you can specify how many bars up to buy and how many bars down to sell. It also has code to check and make sure the condition is still true when launching the official alert, which helps back testing and live results line up, however be sure to enter commission and slippage into the properties to accurately...
