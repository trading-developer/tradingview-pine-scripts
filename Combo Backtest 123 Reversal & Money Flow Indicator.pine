//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//        Indicator  plots  Money  Flow  Indicator  (Chaikin).  This  indicator  looks
//        to  improve  on  Larry  William's  Accumulation  Distribution  formula  that
//        compared  the  closing  price  with  the  opening  price.  In  the  early  1970's,
//        opening  prices  for  stocks  stopped  being  transmitted  by  the  exchanges.
//        This  made  it  difficult  to  calculate  Williams'  formula.  The  Chaikin
//        Oscillator  uses  the  average  price  of  the  bar  calculated  as  follows
//        (High  +  Low)  /2  instead  of  the  Open.
//        The  indicator  subtracts  a  10  period  exponential  moving  average  of  the
//        AccumDist  function  from  a  3  period  exponential  moving  average  of  the
//        AccumDist  function.
