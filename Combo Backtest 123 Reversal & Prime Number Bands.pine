//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Determining  market  trends  has  become  a  science  even  though  a  high  number
//  or  people  still  believe  it’s  a  gambling  game.  Mathematicians,  technicians,
//  brokers  and  investors  have  worked  together  in  developing  quite  several
//  indicators  to  help  them  better  understand  and  forecast  market  movements.
//  The  Prime  Number  Bands  indicator  was  developed  by  Modulus  Financial  Engineering
//  Inc.  This  indicator  is  charted  by  indentifying  the  highest  and  lowest  prime  number
//  in  the  neighborhood  and  plotting  the  two  series  as  a  band.
