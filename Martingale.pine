Script Name: Martingale
Author: saucius
Description: Because market has random wlak but also a martingale property: after a good day, there is a higher probability that another good day will follow than a bad one.

System goes long only: it does not operate when the variation close-to-close in percentage (%) in under a certain buffer (i.e. very little movements are not considered).

There are also rules of money...
