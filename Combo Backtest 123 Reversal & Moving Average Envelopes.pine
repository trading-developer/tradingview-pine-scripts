//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Moving  Average  Envelopes  are  percentage-based  envelopes  set  above  and
//  below  a  moving  average.  The  moving  average,  which  forms  the  base  for
//  this  indicator,  can  be  a  simple  or  exponential  moving  average.  Each
//  envelope  is  then  set  the  same  percentage  above  or  below  the  moving  average.
//  This  creates  parallel  bands  that  follow  price  action.  With  a  moving  average
//  as  the  base,  Moving  Average  Envelopes  can  be  used  as  a  trend  following  indicator.
//  However,  this  indicator  is  not  limited  to  just  trend  following.  The  envelopes
//  can  also  be  used  to  identify  overbought  and  oversold  levels  when  the  trend  is
//  relatively  flat.

//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
