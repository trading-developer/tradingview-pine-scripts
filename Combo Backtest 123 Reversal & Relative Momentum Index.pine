//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  Relative  Momentum  Index  (RMI)  was  developed  by  Roger  Altman.  Impressed
//  with  the  Relative  Strength  Index's  sensitivity  to  the  number  of  look-back
//  periods,  yet  frustrated  with  it's  inconsistent  oscillation  between  defined
//  overbought  and  oversold  levels,  Mr.  Altman  added  a  momentum  component  to  the  RSI.
//  As  mentioned,  the  RMI  is  a  variation  of  the  RSI  indicator.  Instead  of  counting
//  up  and  down  days  from  close  to  close  as  the  RSI  does,  the  RMI  counts  up  and  down
//  days  from  the  close  relative  to  the  close  x-days  ago  where  x  is  not  necessarily
//  1  as  required  by  the  RSI).  So  as  the  name  of  the  indicator  reflects,  "momentum"  is
//  substituted  for  "strength".
