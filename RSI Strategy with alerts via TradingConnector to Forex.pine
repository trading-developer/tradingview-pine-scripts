Script Name: RSI Strategy with alerts via TradingConnector to Forex
Author: Peter_O
Description: Software part of algotrading is simpler than you think. TradingView is a great place to do this actually. To present it, I'm publishing each of the default strategies you can find in Pinescript editor's "built-in" list with slight modification - I'm only adding 2 lines of code, which will trigger alerts, ready to be forwarded to your broker via TradingConnector...
PineScript code:

Pine Scriptâ„¢ strategy
RSI Strategy with alerts via TradingConnector to Forex
//@version=4
strategy("RSI  Strategy  with  alerts  via  TradingConnector  to  Forex",  overlay=true,  default_qty_value=100000)
length  =  input(  14  )
overSold  =  input(  30  )
overBought  =  input(  70  )
price  =  close
vrsi  =  rsi(price,  length)
co  =  crossover(vrsi,  overSold)
cu  =  crossunder(vrsi,  overBought)
if  (not  na(vrsi))
        if  (co)
                strategy.entry("RsiLE",  strategy.long,  comment="RsiLE")
                alert(message='long',  freq=alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)

        if  (cu)
                strategy.entry("RsiSE",  strategy.short,  comment="RsiSE")
                alert(message='short',  freq=alert.freq_once_per_bar_close)
//plot(strategy.equity,  title="equity",  color=color.red,  linewidth=2,  style=plot.style_areabr)
//Lines  of  code  added  to  the  original  built-in  script:  12  and  17  only.
//They  trigger  alerts  ready  to  be  executed  on  real  markets  through  TradingConnector
//available  for  Forex,  indices,  crypto,  stocks  -  anything  your  broker  offers  for  trading  via  MetaTrader4/5
