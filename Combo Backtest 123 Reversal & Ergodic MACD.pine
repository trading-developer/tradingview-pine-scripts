//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  This  is  one  of  the  techniques  described  by  William  Blau  in  his  book
//  "Momentum,  Direction  and  Divergence"  (1995).  If  you  like  to  learn  more,
//  we  advise  you  to  read  this  book.  His  book  focuses  on  three  key  aspects
//  of  trading:  momentum,  direction  and  divergence.  Blau,  who  was  an  electrical
//  engineer  before  becoming  a  trader,  thoroughly  examines  the  relationship
//  between  price  and  momentum  in  step-by-step  examples.  From  this  grounding,
//  he  then  looks  at  the  deficiencies  in  other  oscillators  and  introduces  some
//  innovative  techniques,  including  a  fresh  twist  on  Stochastics.  On  directional
//  issues,  he  analyzes  the  intricacies  of  ADX  and  offers  a  unique  approach  to  help
//  define  trending  and  non-trending  periods.
//  Blau`s  indicator  is  like  usual  MACD,  but  it  plots  opposite  of  meaningof
//  stndard  MACD  indicator.
