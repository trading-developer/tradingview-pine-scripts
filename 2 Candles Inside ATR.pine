Script Name: 2 Candles Inside ATR
Author: SushilKothawade
Description: 2 agitated candles falling inside ATR range, awaiting possibly a big move.
Buy / Sell signals at combined high / low can be used as order with other as stop loss.
Counter trade, when this minimal stop loss is hit, is also as useful. However, wait till the SL candle closes, before opening position on the other side.
Works quite well on 15 mins chart, with settings...
