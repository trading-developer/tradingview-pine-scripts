//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Moving  Average  Displaced  Envelope.  These  envelopes  are  calculated
//  by  multiplying  percentage  factors  with  their  displaced  expotential
//  moving  average  (EMA)  core.
//  How  To  Trade  Using:
//  Adjust  the  envelopes  percentage  factors  to  control  the  quantity  and
//  quality  of  the  signals.  If  a  previous  high  goes  above  the  envelope
//  a  sell  signal  is  generated.  Conversely,  if  the  previous  low  goes  below
//  the  envelope  a  buy  signal  is  given.
