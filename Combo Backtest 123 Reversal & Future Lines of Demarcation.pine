//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//    An  FLD  is  a  line  that  is  plotted  on  the  same  scale  as  the  price  and  is  in  fact  the
//    price  itself  displaced  to  the  right  (into  the  future)  by  (approximately)  half  the
//    wavelength  of  the  cycle  for  which  the  FLD  is  plotted.  There  are  three  FLD's  that  can  be
//    plotted  for  each  cycle:
//        An  FLD  based  on  the  median  price.
//        An  FLD  based  on  the  high  price.
//        An  FLD  based  on  the  low  price.
