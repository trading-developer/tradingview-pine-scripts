Script Name: 10PreBuyer
Author: HermanBrummer
Description: Quite a simple system


  Uses a moving average, the blue line to try and get filled at favorable prices
  The MA is multiplied by a number (e.g. .90) which means the system tries to get filled at a 10% lower price (on the Blue MA line)
  This means that stop limit buy orders have to be set in advance on the blue line and hope that they would get filled when...
