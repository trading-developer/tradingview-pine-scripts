//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  name  ‘Floor-Trader  Pivot,’  came  from  the  fact  that  Pivot  points  can
//  be  calculated  quickly,  on  the  fly  using  price  data  from  the  previous  day
//  as  an  input.  Although  time-frames  of  less  than  a  day  can  be  used,  Pivots  are
//  commonly  plotted  on  the  Daily  Chart;  using  price  data  from  the  previous  day’s
//  trading  activity.
