//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  A  type  of  technical  indicator  that  is  created  by  plotting  two  bands  around
//  a  short-term  simple  moving  average  (SMA)  of  an  underlying  asset's  price.
//  The  upper  band  is  created  by  adding  a  value  of  the  average  true  range
//  (ATR)  -  a  popular  indicator  used  by  technical  traders  -  to  the  moving  average.
//  The  lower  band  is  created  by  subtracting  a  value  of  the  ATR  from  the  SMA.
//  STARC  is  an  acronym  for  Stoller  Average  Range  Channels.  The  indicator  is
//  named  after  its  creator,  Manning  Stoller.
