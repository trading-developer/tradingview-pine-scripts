//THIS  SCRIPT  HAS  BEEN  BUILT  AS  A  STRATEGY  FOR  VISUALIZATION  PURPOSES  ONLY  AND  HAS  NOT  BEEN  OPTIMISED  FOR  PROFIT.
//The  script  has  been  built  to  show  as  a  lower  indicator  and  also  gives  visual  SELL  signal  on  top  when  conditions  are  met.  BARE  IN  MIND  NO  STOP  LOSS,  NOR  ADVANCED  EXIT  STRATEGY  HAS  BEEN  BUILT.
//As  well  as  the  chart  SELL  signal  an  alert  has  also  been  built  into  this  script.
//The  script  utilizes  a  VIX  indicator  (marron  line)  and  50  period  Momentum  (blue  line)  and  Danger/No  trade  zone(pink  shading).
//When  the  Momentum  line  crosses  down  across  the  VIX  this  is  a  sell  off  but  in  order  to  only  signal  major  sell  offs  the  SELL  signal  only  triggers  if  the  momentum  continues  down  through  the  danger  zone.
//To  use  this  indicator  to  identify  ideal  buying  then  you  should  only  buy  when  Momentum  line  is  crossed  above  the  VIX  and  the  Momentum  line  is  above  the  Danger  Zone.
//This  is  best  used  as  a  daily  time  frame  indicator
