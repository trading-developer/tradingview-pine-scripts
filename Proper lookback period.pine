Script Name: Proper lookback period
Author: nemozny
Description: This will allow you to enter the date when the strategy should start trading. It cancels all orders if the the current bar is older than the date you entered in the input field.
Motivation: strategy(lookback) never worked for me and even if it did, it is garbage, because I want to set a date instead of number of bars. I can see on the chart clearly what period is...
PineScript code:

Pine Scriptâ„¢ strategy
Proper lookback period
//@version=4
strategy("Proper  lookback  period",  overlay=true)
startWhen  =  input(title="Enter  date  when  the  strategy  should  start  trading",  type=input.time,  defval=timestamp("2  Jan  1900  00:00  +0000"))
if  (sma(close,  20)  >  sma(close,  200))
        strategy.entry("Long",  strategy.long)
else
        strategy.entry("Short",  strategy.short)
//  This  line  will  cancel  all  orders  if  the  current  bar  preceeds  the  date  you  entered  in  "startWhen"
strategy.cancel_all(when  =  time  <  startWhen)
