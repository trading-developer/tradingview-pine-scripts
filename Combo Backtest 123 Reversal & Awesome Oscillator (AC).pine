//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//        This  indicator  plots  the  oscillator  as  a  histogram  where  blue  denotes
//        periods  suited  for  buying  and  red  .  for  selling.  If  the  current  value
//        of  AO  (Awesome  Oscillator)  is  above  previous,  the  period  is  considered
//        suited  for  buying  and  the  period  is  marked  blue.  If  the  AO  value  is  not
//        above  previous,  the  period  is  considered  suited  for  selling  and  the
//        indicator  marks  it  as  red.
