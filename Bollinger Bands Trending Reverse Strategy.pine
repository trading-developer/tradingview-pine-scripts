Script Name: Bollinger Bands Trending Reverse Strategy
Author: conflixx95493
Description: Welcome to yet another script. This script was a lot easier since I was stuck for so long on the Donchian Channels one and learned so much from that one that I could use in this one.
This code should be a lot cleaner compared to the Donchian Channels, but we'll leave that up to the pro's.

This strategy has two entry signals, long = when price hits lower band,...

//  Welcome  to  yet  another  script.  This  script  was  a  lot  easier  since  I  was  stuck  for  so  long  on  the  Donchian  Channels  one  and  learned  so  much  from  that  one  that  I  could  use  in  this  one
//  This  code  should  be  a  lot  cleaner  compared  to  the  Donchian  Channels,  but  we'll  leave  that  up  to  the  pro's
//  This  strategy  has  two  entry  signals,  long  =  when  price  hits  lower  band,  while  above  EMA,  previous  candle  was  bearish  and  current  candle  is  bullish
//  Short  =  when  price  hits  upper  band,  while  below  EMA,  previous  candle  was  bullish  and  current  candle  is  bearish
//  Take  profits  are  the  opposite  side's  band(lower  band  for  long  signals,  upper  band  for  short  signals).  This  means  our  take  profit  price  will  change  per  bar
//  Our  stop  loss  doesn't  change,  it's  the  difference  between  entry  price  and  the  take  profit  target  divided  by  the  input  risk  reward  which  is  set  on  entering  a  position
//  At  the  time  of  writing  this,  I  could  probably  calculate  that  much  easier  by  simply  multiplying  the  opposite  band  by  the  input  risk  reward  ratio
//  Since  I  want  to  get  this  script  out  and  working  on  the  next  one,  I  won't  clean  that  up,  I'm  sorry
