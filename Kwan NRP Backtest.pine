//  To  calculate  the  coordinates  in  which  the  kink  of  the  line  will  cross,
//the  standard  Forex  instruments  are  used  -  Relative  Strenght  Index,  Stochastic  and  Momentum.
//It  is  very  easy  to  optimize  them  for  the  existing  trading  strategy:  they  all  have  very
//flexible  and  easily  customizable  parameters.  Signals  to  enter  the  market  can  be  2  situations:
//        Change  of  color  of  the  indicator  line  from  red  to  blue.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  worth  entering  into  the  purchase;
//        Change  of  color  of  the  indicator  line  from  blue  to  red.  In  this  case,  it  is  worth  entering  for  sale.
//The  signals  are  extremely  clear  and  can  be  used  in  practice  even  by  beginners.  The  indicator
//itself  shows  when  to  make  deals:  the  user  only  has  to  accompany  them  and  set  the  values
//of  Take  Profit  and  Stop  Loss.  As  a  rule,  the  signal  to  complete  trading  is  the  approach  of
//the  indicator  level  to  the  levels  of  the  maximum  or  minimum  of  the  previous  time  period.
