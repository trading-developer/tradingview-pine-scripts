Script Name: Risk Reduction Ultimate Template
Author: burgercrisis
Description: This is a template not actually meant for trading. I picked two random oscillators. This is a template meant to turn into a live trading strategy, however.

It's literally just a specialized take profit/stop loss system. It is to ensure your bot doesn't make any bad moves that you wouldn't have manually. The code should be pretty well annotated. Putting this into...

//Whats  the  point  of  this?
//This  is  a  strategy  template  for  risk  reduction.  I've  found  that  the  main  problem  with  strategies  on  Tradingview  is  they  do  not  account  for  risk  and  reward  management!  The  ones  that  do,  do  so  very  poorly  and  rudimentarily!
//Utter  lack  of  stop  losses,  rudimentary  and  unconditional  stop  losses  with  no  care  for  changes  in  momentum  that  may  indicate  the  stop  loss  shouldn't  be  taken,  take  profits  occurring  in  the  middle  of  huge  rush  just  because  a  price  was  hit
//and  momentum  based  signals  with  no  care  for  whether  the  sale  is  profitable  or  not,  or  if  price  had  barely  even  changed!
//I  thought  maybe  TA-based  bots  just  aren't  possible  to  actually  be  any  good  for  a  moment.  But  rather  then  give  up,  I  decided  to  try  to  gear  up.  And  I  believe  I  found  a  key  that  can  make  almost  any  strategy  work.  A  path  to  actually  beating  buy  and  hold.
//
//How  do  I  use  this?
//It's  actually  really  simple.  It  might  have  a  lot  of  tiny  pieces  but  that  is  to  maximize  the  users  choices  in  maximizing  risk  adjusted  return  and  its  really  simple  once  you  make  sense  of  it.
//You  have  a  single  buy  signal,  three  stop  losses,  two  take  profits  and  two  (roughly)  standard  sells.
//I  tend  to  use  a  trigger  and  multiple  filter  conditions  for  both  my  buys  and  sales.  This  strategy  doesn't  need  it  for  the  buys  but  that  is  how  you  make  the  sale  system  work  so  for  clarity  there  are  two  conditions  for  buys  –  longtrigger  and  longcondition1.
//The  trigger,  you  want  to  be  something  that  occurs  at  a  single  point  in  time,  such  as  a  crossover  of  some  kind.  The  filter  you  want  to  be  more  loose  and  regional,  such  as  an  overbought  or  oversold  condition.
//The  sells  conditions  are  similar.  You  have  a  shorttrigger  and  two  shortconditions  sets  for  filtering.  The  first  shortcondition  is  to  sell  a  single  set  (depending  on  your  position  sizing  settings  in  properties  tab).
//The  second  shortcondition  is  to  sell  everything  at  more  extreme  settings.  This  is  because  nobody  can  perfectly  time  every  top,  even  with  a  script,  so  you  want  to  take  profits  along  the  way  without  completely  exiting
//and  allowing  yourself  to  re-enter  when  its  right  and  only  fully  exit  at  extreme  cases.  If  you  want  to  use  just  one  set  of  conditions,  move  to  the  last  line  and  replace    shortcondition2  with    shortcondition1.
//Then  you  can  decide  if  selling  all  is  truly  better  then  pyramiding  things  out...  Test  both  %  and  flat  and  you  will  see.
//
//Everything  should  be  pretty  clearly  labeled.
