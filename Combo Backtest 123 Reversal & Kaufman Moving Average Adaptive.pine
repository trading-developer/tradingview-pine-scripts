//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Everyone  wants  a  short-term,  fast  trading  trend  that  works  without  large
//  losses.  That  combination  does  not  exist.  But  it  is  possible  to  have  fast
//  trading  trends  in  which  one  must  get  in  or  out  of  the  market  quickly,  but
//  these  have  the  distinct  disadvantage  of  being  whipsawed  by  market  noise
//  when  the  market  is  volatile  in  a  sideways  trending  market.  During  these
//  periods,  the  trader  is  jumping  in  and  out  of  positions  with  no  profit-making
//  trend  in  sight.  In  an  attempt  to  overcome  the  problem  of  noise  and  still  be
//  able  to  get  closer  to  the  actual  change  of  the  trend,  Kaufman  developed  an
//  indicator  that  adapts  to  market  movement.  This  indicator,  an  adaptive  moving
//  average  (AMA),  moves  very  slowly  when  markets  are  moving  sideways  but  moves
//  swiftly  when  the  markets  also  move  swiftly,  change  directions  or  break  out  of
//  a  trading  range.
