//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  RVI  is  a  modified  form  of  the  relative  strength  index  (RSI).
//  The  original  RSI  calculation  separates  one-day  net  changes  into
//  positive  closes  and  negative  closes,  then  smoothes  the  data  and
//  normalizes  the  ratio  on  a  scale  of  zero  to  100  as  the  basis  for  the
//  formula.  The  RVI  uses  the  same  basic  formula  but  substitutes  the
//  10-day  standard  deviation  of  the  closing  prices  for  either  the  up
//  close  or  the  down  close.  The  goal  is  to  create  an  indicator  that
//  measures  the  general  direction  of  volatility.  The  volatility  is
//  being  measured  by  the  10-days  standard  deviation  of  the  closing  prices.
