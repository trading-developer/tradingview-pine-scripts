//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//        This  indicator  is  based  on  Bill  Williams`  recommendations  from  his  book
//        "New  Trading  Dimensions".  We  recommend  this  book  to  you  as  most  useful  reading.
//        The  wisdom,  technical  expertise,  and  skillful  teaching  style  of  Williams  make
//        it  a  truly  revolutionary-level  source.  A  must-have  new  book  for  stock  and
//        commodity  traders.
//        The  1st  2  chapters  are  somewhat  of  ramble  where  the  author  describes  the
//        "metaphysics"  of  trading.  Still  some  good  ideas  are  offered.  The  book  references
//        chaos  theory,  and  leaves  it  up  to  the  reader  to  believe  whether  "supercomputers"
//        were  used  in  formulating  the  various  trading  methods  (the  author  wants  to  come  across
//        as  an  applied  mathemetician,  but  he  sure  looks  like  a  stock  trader).  There  isn't  any
//        obvious  connection  with  Chaos  Theory  -  despite  of  the  weak  link  between  the  title  and
//        content,  the  trading  methodologies  do  work.  Most  readers  think  the  author's  systems  to
//        be  a  perfect  filter  and  trigger  for  a  short  term  trading  system.  He  states  a  goal  of
//        10%/month,  but  when  these  filters  &  axioms  are  correctly  combined  with  a  good  momentum
//        system,  much  more  is  a  probable  result.
//        There's  better  written  &  more  informative  books  out  there  for  less  money,  but  this  author
//        does  have  the  "Holy  Grail"  of  stock  trading.  A  set  of  filters,  axioms,  and  methods  which  are
//        the  "missing  link"  for  any  trading  system  which  is  based  upon  conventional  indicators.
//        This  indicator  plots  the  oscillator  as  a  histogram  where  periods  fit  for  buying  are  marked
//        as  blue,  and  periods  fit  for  selling  as  red.  If  the  current  value  of  AC  (Awesome  Oscillator)
//        is  over  the  previous,  the  period  is  deemed  fit  for  buying  and  the  indicator  is  marked  blue.
//        If  the  AC  values  is  not  over  the  previous,  the  period  is  deemed  fir  for  selling  and  the  indicator
//        is  marked  red.
