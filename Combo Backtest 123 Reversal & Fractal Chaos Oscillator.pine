//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//      The  value  of  Fractal  Chaos  Oscillator  is  calculated  as  the  difference  between
//  the  most  subtle  movements  of  the  market.  In  general,  its  value  moves  between
//  -1.000  and  1.000.  The  higher  the  value  of  the  Fractal  Chaos  Oscillator,  the
//  more  one  can  say  that  it  follows  a  certain  trend  –  an  increase  in  prices  trend,
//  or  a  decrease  in  prices  trend.
//
//      Being  an  indicator  expressed  in  a  numeric  value,  traders  say  that  this  is  an
//  indicator  that  puts  a  value  on  the  trendiness  of  the  markets.  When  the  FCO  reaches
//  a  high  value,  they  initiate  the  “buy”  operation,  contrarily  when  the  FCO  reaches  a
//  low  value,  they  signal  the  “sell”  action.  This  is  an  excellent  indicator  to  use  in
//  intra-day  trading.

//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
