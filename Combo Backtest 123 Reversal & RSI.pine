//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  RSI  is  a  very  popular  indicator  that  follows  price  activity.
//  It  calculates  an  average  of  the  positive  net  changes,  and  an  average
//  of  the  negative  net  changes  in  the  most  recent  bars,  and  it  determines
//  the  ratio  between  these  averages.  The  result  is  expressed  as  a  number
//  between  0  and  100.  Commonly  it  is  said  that  if  the  RSI  has  a  low  value,
//  for  example  30  or  under,  the  symbol  is  oversold.  And  if  the  RSI  has  a
//  high  value,  70  for  example,  the  symbol  is  overbought.

//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
