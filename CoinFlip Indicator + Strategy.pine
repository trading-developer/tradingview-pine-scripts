Script Name: CoinFlip Indicator + Strategy
Author: johntheshen
Description: Flip a coin every Monday.

Heads, go long. Tail, go short. Stoploss at 1 ATR, and Take profit at 1 ATR too. 1:1 risk to reward ratio.

After backtesting 2018, 2019, and 2020 with 28 major currency pairs. We are getting close to a 50% win rate with an 8% standard deviation.

Believe it or not, this simple performs better than lots of the popular indicators out...
