Script Name: polynomic_stop
Author: IntelTrading
Description: A strategy with a trailing stop in the form of a polynomial function. The entry is made at the intersection of a simple sliding closing candle. At the moment of entering the position, it is fixed by the value of the Minimum for the period. After entering the position, a trailing stop of the form is activated: Min + D * N^a, where Min is the minimum for the period...
