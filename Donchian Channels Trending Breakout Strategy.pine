Script Name: Donchian Channels Trending Breakout Strategy
Author: conflixx95493
Description: This script looks for two entry signals. Long is when the previous breakout of the donchian channels was a low, price is above the input EMA, current price is equal or higher than the upper band and we're not in a position yet. Short is the other way around, so previous breakout of the donchian channels was a high, price is below the input EMA, current price is...

Donchian Channels Trending Breakout Strategy
//@version=4
//  Welcome  to  my  second  script  on  Tradingview  with  Pinescript
//  First  of,  I'm  sorry  for  the  amount  of  comments  on  this  script,  this  script  was  a  challenge  for  me,  fun  one  for  sure,  but  I  wanted  to  thoroughly  go  through  every  step  before  making  the  script  public
//  Glad  I  did  so  because  I  fixed  some  weird  things  and  I  ended  up  forgetting  to  add  the  EMA  into  the  equation  so  our  entry  signals  were  a  mess
//  This  one  was  a  lot  tougher  to  complete  compared  to  my  MACD  crossover  trend  strategy  but  I  learned  a  ton  from  it,  which  is  always  good  and  fun
//  Also  I'll  explain  the  strategy  and  how  I  got  there  through  some  creative  coding(I'm  saying  creative  because  I  had  to  figure  this  stuff  out  by  myself  as  I  couldn't  find  any  reference  codes)
//  First  things  first.  This  is  a  Donchian  Channel  Breakout  strategy  which  follows  the  following  rules
//  If  the  price  hits  the  upperband  of  the  Donchian  Channel  +  price  is  above  EMA  and  the  price  previously  hit  the  lowerband  of  the  Donchian  Channel  it's  a  buy  signal
//  If  the  price  hits  the  lowerband  of  the  Donchian  Channel  +  price  is  below  EMA  and  the  price  prevbiously  hit  the  upper  band  of  the  Donchian  Channel  it's  a  sell  signal
//  Stop  losses  are  set  at  the  lower  or  upper  band  with  a  0.5%  deviation  because  we  are  acting  as  if  those  two  bands  are  the  resistance  in  this  case
//  Last  but  not  least(yes,  this  gave  BY  FAR  the  most  trouble  to  code),  the  profit  target  is  set  with  a  1.5  risk  to  reward  ratio
//  If  you  have  any  suggestions  to  make  my  code  more  efficient,  I'll  be  happy  to  hear  so  from  you
//  So  without  further  ado,  let's  walk  through  the  code
//  The  first  line  is  basically  standard  because  it  makes  backtesting  so  much  more  easy,  commission  value  is  based  on  Binance  futures  fees  when  you're  using  BNB  to  pay  those  fees  in  the  futures  market
