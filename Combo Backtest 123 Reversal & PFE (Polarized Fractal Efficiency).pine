//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  Polarized  Fractal  Efficiency  (PFE)  indicator  measures  the  efficiency
//  of  price  movements  by  drawing  on  concepts  from  fractal  geometry  and  chaos
//  theory.  The  more  linear  and  efficient  the  price  movement,  the  shorter  the
//  distance  the  prices  must  travel  between  two  points  and  thus  the  more  efficient
//  the  price  movement.
