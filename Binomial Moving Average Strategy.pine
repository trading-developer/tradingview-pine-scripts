Script Name: Binomial Moving Average Strategy
Author: HosseinDaftary
Description: Binomial Moving Average:
This type of moving average that is made by myself and i did not see anywhere before uses the half of binomial coefficients for
averaging the prices for example if the period be 5 then we use the 9 degree binomial coefficients(that yields 10 coefficients) and use half of them.
we use 126/256 for last bar,84/256,36/256,9/256 and finally use...
