//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  indicator  represents  the  relative  convergence/divergence  of  the  moving
//  averages  of  the  financial  asset,  increased  a  hundred  times.  It  is  based  on
//  a  different  principle  than  the  ADX.  Chande  suggests  a  13-week  SMA  as  the
//  basis  for  the  indicator.  It  represents  the  quarterly  (3  months  =  65  working  days)
//  sentiments  of  the  market  participants  concerning  prices.  The  short  moving  average
//  comprises  10%  of  the  one  and  is  rounded  to  seven.
