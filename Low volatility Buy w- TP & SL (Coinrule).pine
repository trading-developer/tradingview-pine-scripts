Script Name: Low volatility Buy w- TP & SL (Coinrule)
Author: Coinrule
Description: The compression of volatility usually leads to expansion. When the breakout comes, it can ignite strong trends. One way to catch a coin trading in an accumulation area is to spot three moving averages with values close to each other. The strategy uses a combination of Moving Averages to spot the best time to buy a coin before its breakout.
