Author: Noldo
Description: Hello there.
I was looking for a way to simulate leveraged transactions in Tradingview and this script came out.
You can examine the equity graph without looking at the strategy results.
Thus, the facts will come to light.
Strategy parameters:

 Adding margin:  Forbidden or not specified. (Add Margin : No)


 Position size: (for each trade) 1%
