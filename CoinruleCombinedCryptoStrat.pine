Script Name: CoinruleCombinedCryptoStrat
Author: SnoDragon
Description: Utilizes a combination of RSI and MA to determine the best time to acquire cryptocurrencies and then sell when the markets are reaching peak prices. Best followed on lower time frames. Based on a strategy of averaging down during dips then selling at peaks with the highest volume first, then slowly liquidating as the price increases in percentage of holdings.
