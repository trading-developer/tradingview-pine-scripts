Script Name: Reinforced RSI - The Quant Science
Author: thequantscience
Description: This strategy was designed and written with the goal of showing and motivating the community how to integrate our 'Probabilities' module with their own script.

We have recreated one of the simplest strategies used by many traders. The strategy only trades long and uses the overbought and oversold levels on the RSI indicator.

We added stop losses and take...
