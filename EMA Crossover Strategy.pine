Script Name: EMA Crossover Strategy

Description: Moving average crossover systems measure drift in the market. They are great strategies for time-limited people.
So, why don't more people use them?

I think it's due to poor choice in choosing EMA lengths: Market Wizard Ed Seykota has a guideline for moving average crossovers: the slow line should be at least 3x the fast line. This removes a lot of the whipsaws...

//  Moving  average  crossover  systems  measure  drift  in  the  market.  They  are  great  strategies  for  time-limited  people.
//  So,  why  don't  more  people  use  them?
//
//  I  think  it's  due  to  poor  choice  in  choosing  EMA  lengths:  Market  Wizard  Ed  Seykota  has  a  guideline  for  moving  average  crossovers:  the  slow  line  should  be  at  least  3x  the  fast  line.
//  This  removes  a  lot  of  the  whipsaws  inherent  in  moving  average  systems,  which  means  greater  profitability.
//  His  other  piece  of  advice:  long-only  strategies  are  best  in  stock  markets  where  there's  a  lot  more  upside  potential.
//
//  Using  these  simple  rules,  we  can  reduce  a  lot  of  the  whipsaws  and  low  profitability  trades!  This  strategy  was  made  so  you  can  see  for  yourself  before  trading.
//
//  ===  HOW  TO  USE  THIS  INDICATOR  ===
//  1)  Choose  your  market  and  timeframe.
//  2)  Choose  the  length.
//  3)  Choose  the  multiplier.
//  4)  Choose  if  the  strategy  is  long-only  or  bidirectional.
//
//  Don't  overthink  the  above!  We  don't  know  the  best  answers,  that's  why  this  strategy  exists!  We're  going  to  test  and  find  out.
//    After  you  find  a  good  combination,  set  up  an  alert  system  with  the  default  Exponential  Moving  Average  indicators  provided  by  TradingView.
//
//  ===  TIPS  ===
//  Increase  the  multiplier  to  reduce  whipsaws  (back  and  forth  trades).
//  Increase  the  length  to  take  fewer  trades,  decrease  the  length  to  take  more  trades.
//  Try  a  Long-Only  strategy  to  see  if  that  performs  better.
