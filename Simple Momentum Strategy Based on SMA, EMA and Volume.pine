Script Name: Simple Momentum Strategy Based on SMA, EMA and Volume
Author: slip_stream
Description: A simple, non short selling (long positions only, i.e. buy low and sell high) strategy. Strategy makes use of simple SMA, EMA and Volume indicators to attempt to enter the market at the most optimum time (i.e. when momentum and price are moving upwards). Optimum time is defined mainly by picking best timing for price moves higher based on upwards momentum.

//  Simple  strategy  for  riding  the  momentum  and  optimising  the  timings  of  truer/longer  price  moves  upwards  for  an  long  posistions  on  a  daily  basis  (can  be  used,  but  with  less  effect
//  on  other  time  frames.  Volume  settings  would  have  to  be  adjusted  by  the  user  accordingly.  (short  positions  are  not  used).
//  This  strategy  has  default  settings  of  a  short(er)  SMA  of  10,  a  long(er)  EMA  of  20,  and  Volume  trigger  of  10  units  and  above.  All  these  settings  can  be  changed  by  the  user
//  using  the  GUI  settings  and  not  having  to  change  the  script.
//  The  strategy  will  only  open  a  long  position  when  there  is  a  clear  indication  that  price  momentum  is  upwards  through  the  SMA  moving  and  remaining  above  the  EMA  (mandatory)  and  price  period  indicators
//  of  either  1)  a  standard  3  bar  movement  upwards,  2)  a  standard  but  "aggressive"  3  or  4  bar  play  where  the  low  of  the  middle  resting  bars  can  be  equal  to  or  higher  than  (i.e.  not
//  the  more  standard  low  of  about  half)  of  the  opening  of  the  ignition  bar.  The  "aggression"  of  the  3/4  bar  play  was  done  in  order  to  counteract  the  conservatisme  of  having  a  mandatory
//  SMA  remaining  higher  than  the  EMA  (this  would  have  to  be  changed  in  the  script  by  the  user  if  they  want  to  optimise  to  their  own  specifications.  However,  be  warned,  all  programmatic
//  settings  for  the  maximum  acceptable  low  of  the  middle  resting  bars  runs  a  risk  of  ignoring  good  entry  points  due  to  the  low  being  minutely  e.g.  0.01%,  lower  than  the  user  defined  setting)
