Script Name: Aroon Strategy long only
Author: exlux99
Description: This is a simple long only strategy made of Aroon and Least Square moving average.

The rules are simple:

Long entry = crossover of upper part with the lower part from aroon and close of the candle is above the moving average

Long exit = crossunder of upper part with the lower part from aroon and close of the candle is below the moving average
