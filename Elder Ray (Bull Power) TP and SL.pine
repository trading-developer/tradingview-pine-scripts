//  Dr  Elder  uses  a  13-day  exponential  moving  average  (EMA)  to  indicate  the
//  market  consensus  of  value.  Bull  Power  measures  the  ability  of  buyers  to
//  drive  prices  above  the  consensus  of  value.  Bear  Power  reflects  the  ability
//  of  sellers  to  drive  prices  below  the  average  consensus  of  value.
//  Bull  Power  is  calculated  by  subtracting  the  13-day  EMA  from  the  day's  High.
//  Bear  power  subtracts  the  13-day  EMA  from  the  day's  Low.
