//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Accumulation  is  a  term  used  to  describe  a  market  controlled  by  buyers;
//  whereas  distribution  is  defined  by  a  market  controlled  by  sellers.
//  Williams  recommends  trading  this  indicator  based  on  divergences:
//    Distribution  of  the  security  is  indicated  when  the  security  is  making
//    a  new  high  and  the  A/D  indicator  is  failing  to  make  a  new  high.  Sell.
//    Accumulation  of  the  security  is  indicated  when  the  security  is  making
//    a  new  low  and  the  A/D  indicator  is  failing  to  make  a  new  low.  Buy.

//  WARNING:
//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
