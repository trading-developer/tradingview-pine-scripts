//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.

//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  This  indicator  plots  the  Fast  &  Slow  Kurtosis.  The  Kurtosis  is  a  market
//  sentiment  indicator.  The  Kurtosis  is  constructed  from  three  different  parts.
//  The  Kurtosis,  the  Fast  Kurtosis(FK),  and  the  Fast/Slow  Kurtosis(FSK).
