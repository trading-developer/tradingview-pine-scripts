//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  Mass  Index  was  designed  to  identify  trend  reversals  by  measuring
//  the  narrowing  and  widening  of  the  range  between  the  high  and  low  prices.
//  As  this  range  widens,  the  Mass  Index  increases;  as  the  range  narrows
//  the  Mass  Index  decreases.
//  The  Mass  Index  was  developed  by  Donald  Dorsey.
