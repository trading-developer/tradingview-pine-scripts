//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  This  indicator  plots  the  moving  average  described  in  the  January,  1998  issue
//  of  S&C,  p.57,  "Smoothing  Techniques  for  More  Accurate  Signals",  by  Tim  Tillson.
//  This  indicator  plots  T3  moving  average  presented  in  Figure  4  in  the  article.
//  T3  indicator  is  a  moving  average  which  is  calculated  according  to  formula:
//          T3(n)  =  GD(GD(GD(n))),
//  where  GD  -  generalized  DEMA  (Double  EMA)  and  calculating  according  to  this:
//          GD(n,v)  =  EMA(n)  *  (1+v)-EMA(EMA(n))  *  v,
//  where  "v"  is  volume  factor,  which  determines  how  hot  the  moving  average’s  response
//  to  linear  trends  will  be.  The  author  advises  to  use  v=0.7.
//  When  v  =  0,  GD  =  EMA,  and  when  v  =  1,  GD  =  DEMA.  In  between,  GD  is  a  less  aggressive
//  version  of  DEMA.  By  using  a  value  for  v  less  than1,  trader  cure  the  multiple  DEMA
//  overshoot  problem  but  at  the  cost  of  accepting  some  additional  phase  delay.
//  In  filter  theory  terminology,  T3  is  a  six-pole  nonlinear  Kalman  filter.  Kalman
//  filters  are  ones  that  use  the  error  —  in  this  case,  (time  series  -  EMA(n))  —
//  to  correct  themselves.  In  the  realm  of  technical  analysis,  these  are  called  adaptive
//  moving  averages;  they  track  the  time  series  more  aggres-sively  when  it  is  making  large
//  moves.  Tim  Tillson  is  a  software  project  manager  at  Hewlett-Packard,  with  degrees  in
//  mathematics  and  computer  science.  He  has  privately  traded  options  and  equities  for  15  years.
