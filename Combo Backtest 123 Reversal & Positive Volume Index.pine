//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  The  theory  behind  the  indexes  is  as  follows:  On  days  of  increasing  volume,
//  you  can  expect  prices  to  increase,  and  on  days  of  decreasing  volume,  you  can
//  expect  prices  to  decrease.  This  goes  with  the  idea  of  the  market  being  in-gear
//  and  out-of-gear.  Both  PVI  and  NVI  work  in  similar  fashions:  Both  are  a  running
//  cumulative  of  values,  which  means  you  either  keep  adding  or  subtracting  price
//  rate  of  change  each  day  to  the  previous  day`s  sum.  In  the  case  of  PVI,  if  today`s
//  volume  is  less  than  yesterday`s,  don`t  add  anything;  if  today`s  volume  is  greater,
//  then  add  today`s  price  rate  of  change.  For  NVI,  add  today`s  price  rate  of  change
//  only  if  today`s  volume  is  less  than  yesterday`s.

//  WARNING:
//  -  For  purpose  educate  only
//  -  This  script  to  change  bars  colors.
