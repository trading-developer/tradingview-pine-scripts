Script Name: VWAP Push Strategy
Author: christopher451
Description: This strategy is unfortunately not finished yet.

A pretty simple strategy. If price broke through VWAP and had three consecutive candles following the breakthroughs trend, the high of the third candle will be drawn. If this happened after a crossover of the vwap and price breaks through the high of the third candle, strategy will go long. Short will be the same...
