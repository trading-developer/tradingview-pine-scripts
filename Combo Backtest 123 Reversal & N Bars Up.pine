//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.

//  Second  strategy
//  Evaluates  for  n  number  of  consecutive  higher  closes.  Returns  a  value
