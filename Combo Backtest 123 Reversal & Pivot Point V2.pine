//  This  is  combo  strategies  for  get  a  cumulative  signal.
//
//  First  strategy
//  This  System  was  created  from  the  Book  "How  I  Tripled  My  Money  In  The
//  Futures  Market"  by  Ulf  Jensen,  Page  183.  This  is  reverse  type  of  strategies.
//  The  strategy  buys  at  market,  if  close  price  is  higher  than  the  previous  close
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Slow  Oscillator  is  lower  than  50.
//  The  strategy  sells  at  market,  if  close  price  is  lower  than  the  previous  close  price
//  during  2  days  and  the  meaning  of  9-days  Stochastic  Fast  Oscillator  is  higher  than  50.
//
//  Second  strategy
//  Pivot  points  simply  took  the  high,  low,  and  closing  price  from  the  previous  period  and
//  divided  by  3  to  find  the  pivot.  From  this  pivot,  traders  would  then  base  their
//  calculations  for  three  support,  and  three  resistance  levels.  The  calculation  for  the  most
//  basic  flavor  of  pivot  points,  known  as  ‘floor-trader  pivots’,  along  with  their  support  and
//  resistance  levels.
