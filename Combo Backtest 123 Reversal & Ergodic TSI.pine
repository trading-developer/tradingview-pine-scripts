//  This  is  one  of  the  techniques  described  by  William  Blau  in  his  book  "Momentum,
//  Direction  and  Divergence"  (1995).  If  you  like  to  learn  more,  we  advise  you  to
//  read  this  book.  His  book  focuses  on  three  key  aspects  of  trading:  momentum,
//  direction  and  divergence.  Blau,  who  was  an  electrical  engineer  before  becoming
//  a  trader,  thoroughly  examines  the  relationship  between  price  and  momentum  in
//  step-by-step  examples.  From  this  grounding,  he  then  looks  at  the  deficiencies
//  in  other  oscillators  and  introduces  some  innovative  techniques,  including  a
//  fresh  twist  on  Stochastics.  On  directional  issues,  he  analyzes  the  intricacies
//  of  ADX  and  offers  a  unique  approach  to  help  define  trending  and  non-trending  periods.
